# ANSISnake
It is a console snake game in ANSI C. It's my first project in C... and last game in C.

I wrote this game on first semestr of University in console Emacs, by ssh ðŸ˜‚.

Some cool thinks you will find here a linked list in C, some basic tricks with console and a lot of pointers.

## Build and run
You can build game with command `make.sh`.

```sh
gcc -o snake snake.c -Wall -pedantic
```

And after that run by
```sh
./snake
```

Have fun!
